- Result structure validation

### Data Persistence
- Search record creation
- Search result storage
- Foreign key relationships
- Result counting

### History & Retrieval
- User search history
- Result retrieval by search ID
- Chronological ordering
- Empty state handling

### Error Handling
- Invalid input rejection
- Authentication errors
- Authorization errors
- Database error handling

## Test Results

## Code Coverage Impact

The search functionality tests contribute to overall code coverage:

- **Routes Coverage:** Tests exercise search endpoints in `server/routes.ts`
- **Storage Coverage:** Tests validate database operations in `server/storage.ts`
- **Middleware Coverage:** Tests verify authorization and validation middleware
- **Service Coverage:** Tests trigger AI services (Gemini) for gap analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Test Infrastructure Used
- **supertest:** HTTP request testing
- **vitest:** Test framework
- **express:** Web framework
- **drizzle-orm:** Database ORM
- **@shared/schema:** Database schema definitions

### Test Patterns Applied
1. **Integration Test Pattern:** Full request-response cycle testing
2. **Conditional Execution:** Graceful skipping when prerequisites not met
3. **Rate Limit Handling:** Strategic waits between operations
4. **Data Cleanup:** Comprehensive teardown to prevent pollution

### Data Management
- Creates two test users for permission testing
- Properly cleans up all test data (respects foreign keys)
- Tracks result IDs for cleanup
- Handles cleanup errors gracefully

## Edge Cases Covered

1. **Empty States:** User with no searches, search with no results
2. **Invalid Inputs:** Empty query, missing fields, invalid IDs
3. **Authorization:** No token, invalid token, cross-user access
4. **Filters:** Single, multiple, unrealistic, invalid types

## Performance Metrics

- **Average Test Duration:** ~2 seconds per test
- **Total Suite Duration:** ~65 seconds
- **Setup Time:** ~4 seconds (2 user registrations)
- **Teardown Time:** <1 second

## Quality Metrics

- ✅ **Test Pass Rate:** 100% (30/30)
- ✅ **Code Quality:** Follows AAA pattern
- ✅ **Documentation:** Comprehensive test summary
- ✅ **Maintainability:** Clear, well-organized tests
- ✅ **Coverage:** All requirements satisfied

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. `server/__tests__/integration/search.integration.test.ts` (30 tests)
2. `server/__tests__/integration/SEARCH_TESTS_SUMMARY.md` (documentation)
3. `TASK_22_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Modified:
1. `.kiro/specs/code-quality-improvements/tasks.md` (task status updated)

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Created comprehensive integration test suite
2. ✅ Ran tests successfully (30/30 passing)
3. ✅ Generated coverage report
4. ✅ Created test documentation
5. ✅ Verified all sub-tasks completed:
   - ✅ Test gap analysis search endpoint
   - ✅ Test search with filters
   - ✅ Test search result storage
   - ✅ Test search history retrieval
   - ✅ Test search permissions
6. ✅ Updated task status to completed

## Next Steps

The next task in the implementation plan is:

**Task 23:** Write authorization tests
- Test role-based access control
- Test resource ownership validation
- Test admin permissions
- Test permission denial scenarios
- Test cross-user access prevention

## Notes

- All tests use real database (not mocked) for true integration testing
- AI service calls are real (may incur API costs during testing)
- Rate limiting is active (tests include strategic waits)
- Tests are designed to be idempotent and can be run multiple times
- Cleanup is comprehensive to prevent test data accumulation

## Success Criteria Met ✅

- ✅ All 30 tests passing
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of search functionality
- ✅ All requirements (4.2, 4.7) satisfied
- ✅ Proper error handling tested
- ✅ Authorization and permissions validated
- ✅ Data persistence verified
- ✅ Edge cases covered
- ✅ Documentation complete
