# Requirements Document - Code Quality Improvements

## Introduction

Following the successful security hardening phase and initial bug fixes, this specification outlines the requirements for Phase 2 of the improvement roadmap: Code Quality Improvements. The goal is to eliminate remaining TypeScript errors, improve type safety, audit unused services, and establish a solid foundation for feature development.

## Context

**Current State:**
- Security overhaul completed ✅
- Critical server-side bugs fixed ✅
- ~500KB bloat removed ✅
- 17 TypeScript errors remaining (all frontend)
- Some services need usage audit
- Test coverage needs expansion

**Business Impact:**
- Improved maintainability reduces technical debt
- Better type safety prevents runtime errors
- Cleaner codebase accelerates feature development
- Higher code quality improves team velocity

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Frontend TypeScript Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript errors resolved so that I can trust the type system and catch bugs at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run check` THEN the command SHALL complete with 0 TypeScript errors
2. WHEN viewing `CollaborationChat.tsx` THEN all message objects SHALL have proper type definitions including the 'type' property
3. WHEN viewing `layout-new.tsx` THEN all user object references SHALL use proper User type instead of empty object type
4. WHEN viewing `analytics-dashboard.tsx` THEN all Treemap component props SHALL have explicit types with no implicit 'any'
5. WHEN building the application THEN the build SHALL succeed without type errors
6. WHEN running in development mode THEN no type-related warnings SHALL appear in the console

### Requirement 2: Audit and Clean Unused Services

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to know which services are actually used so that I can remove dead code and reduce maintenance burden.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing `server/services/perplexity.ts` THEN it SHALL be documented as used OR removed if unused
2. WHEN auditing `server/services/email.ts` THEN it SHALL be documented as used OR removed if unused
3. WHEN auditing `server/services/pdf-generator.ts` THEN it SHALL be documented as used OR removed if unused
4. WHEN a service is marked as unused THEN all imports and references SHALL be removed
5. WHEN a service is marked as used THEN it SHALL be documented in a SERVICES.md file with usage examples
6. WHEN removing unused services THEN related dependencies SHALL be removed from package.json
7. WHEN the audit is complete THEN a SERVICE_AUDIT.md report SHALL be created

### Requirement 3: Improve Type Safety Across Codebase

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent and strict type definitions so that I can catch errors early and have better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining user session types THEN a proper UserSession interface SHALL exist in shared types
2. WHEN using req.user in middleware THEN it SHALL use the full User type consistently
3. WHEN defining API response types THEN they SHALL be exported from shared/types.ts
4. WHEN using any third-party libraries THEN proper @types packages SHALL be installed
5. WHEN implicit 'any' types are found THEN they SHALL be replaced with explicit types
6. WHEN strict null checks are enabled THEN all nullable values SHALL be properly handled
7. WHEN the codebase is reviewed THEN no 'as any' type assertions SHALL exist except where absolutely necessary with comments explaining why

### Requirement 4: Expand Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can refactor with confidence and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing authentication flow THEN integration tests SHALL cover login, register, logout, and token refresh
2. WHEN testing search functionality THEN tests SHALL cover gap analysis, filters, and result storage
3. WHEN testing authorization THEN tests SHALL cover all permission levels and resource ownership
4. WHEN running `npm test` THEN all tests SHALL pass
5. WHEN measuring coverage THEN core business logic SHALL have >70% coverage
6. WHEN security features are tested THEN all security middleware SHALL have dedicated tests
7. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Requirement 5: Fix Remaining Middleware Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all middleware to be properly typed and functional so that the request pipeline is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing `httpsEnforcement.ts` THEN all async/await chains SHALL be properly handled
2. WHEN security logging is called THEN it SHALL use the correct function signature
3. WHEN middleware is executed THEN it SHALL not cause runtime errors
4. WHEN TypeScript checks middleware THEN no syntax errors SHALL be reported
5. WHEN middleware handles errors THEN they SHALL be properly caught and logged
6. WHEN middleware is tested THEN it SHALL have unit tests covering all code paths

### Requirement 6: Documentation and Code Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and organized code so that I can quickly understand and modify the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service is used THEN it SHALL be documented in SERVICES.md with purpose and usage
2. WHEN middleware is created THEN it SHALL have JSDoc comments explaining its purpose
3. WHEN types are defined THEN they SHALL be in appropriate shared/ files
4. WHEN the project structure is reviewed THEN it SHALL match PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
5. WHEN new developers join THEN they SHALL find a CONTRIBUTING.md with setup instructions
6. WHEN code is complex THEN it SHALL have inline comments explaining the logic
7. WHEN APIs are exposed THEN they SHALL be documented in docs/API.md

## Success Criteria

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [x] `npm run check` passes with 0 errors



- [x] All services are documented or removed



- [x] Test coverage >70% for core features



- [x] No implicit 'any' types in codebase


- [x] All middleware properly typed and tested


- [x] Documentation updated and complete



### Quality Metrics:
- **Type Safety:** 100% (0 TypeScript errors)
- **Test Coverage:** >70% for business logic
- **Code Duplication:** <5%
- **Documentation:** All public APIs documented
- **Build Time:** <30 seconds for production build

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
1. TypeScript compilation SHALL complete in <10 seconds
2. Test suite SHALL run in <60 seconds
3. No performance regressions from type improvements

### Maintainability
1. Code SHALL follow consistent style (enforced by linter)
2. Functions SHALL be <50 lines where possible
3. Files SHALL be <500 lines where possible
4. Cyclomatic complexity SHALL be <10 per function

### Developer Experience
1. IDE autocomplete SHALL work for all types
2. Error messages SHALL be clear and actionable
3. Setup instructions SHALL be complete and accurate
4. Hot reload SHALL work in development

## Dependencies

### Required Before Starting:
- ✅ Security hardening complete
- ✅ Critical bugs fixed
- ✅ Bloat removed
- ✅ Environment configured

### Blocking Issues:
- None identified

### External Dependencies:
- TypeScript 5.6.3
- Vitest for testing
- ESLint for linting

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Breaking Changes
**Impact:** High  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** 
- Run full test suite after each change
- Test in development environment first
- Keep git commits small and focused

### Risk 2: Time Overrun
**Impact:** Medium  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize high-impact fixes first
- Set time boxes for each requirement
- Document any deferred work

### Risk 3: Introducing New Bugs
**Impact:** High  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Write tests before fixing issues
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Peer review all changes

## Timeline Estimate

- **Requirement 1 (Frontend TS Errors):** 4-6 hours
- **Requirement 2 (Service Audit):** 2-3 hours
- **Requirement 3 (Type Safety):** 3-4 hours
- **Requirement 4 (Test Coverage):** 6-8 hours
- **Requirement 5 (Middleware Fixes):** 2-3 hours
- **Requirement 6 (Documentation):** 2-3 hours

**Total Estimated Time:** 19-27 hours (2.5-3.5 days)
