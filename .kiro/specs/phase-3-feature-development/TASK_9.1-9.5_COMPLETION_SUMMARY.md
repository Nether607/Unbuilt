## Technical Architecture

### Service Layer
```
exportService.ts (Orchestrator)
├── pdf-generator.ts (HTML → PDF)
├── excel-generator.ts (Data → XLSX)
├── pptx-generator.ts (Data → PPTX)
└── JSON.stringify (Data → JSON)
```

### Progress Tracking Flow
```
1. Client initiates export with unique ID
2. Server updates progress map
3. Client polls /api/export/progress/:id
4. Server returns current progress
5. Client updates UI
6. On completion, download triggers
```

### Email Delivery Flow
```
1. Export completes → Buffer created
2. Nodemailer configured with SMTP
3. Email sent with attachment
4. Success notification to user
```

---

## API Endpoints Required

The following API endpoints need to be implemented in the backend:

### POST /api/export
**Request:**
```typescript
{
  exportId: string;
  format: 'pdf' | 'excel' | 'pptx' | 'json';
  results: SearchResult[];
  options: ExportOptions;
}
```

**Response:**
- Binary file download (Buffer)
- Content-Type based on format
- Content-Disposition with filename

### GET /api/export/progress/:exportId
**Response:**
```typescript
{
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'complete' | 'error';
  progress: number; // 0-100
  message: string;
  error?: string;
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test each export format generator
- [ ] Test progress tracking mechanism
- [ ] Test email delivery (with mock SMTP)
- [ ] Test error handling for each format

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test full export flow for each format
- [ ] Test progress polling
- [ ] Test email + download combination
- [ ] Test Pro feature gating

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Export PDF and verify formatting
- [ ] Export Excel and verify all sheets
- [ ] Export PowerPoint and verify slides
- [ ] Export JSON and verify structure
- [ ] Test progress bar updates
- [ ] Test email delivery
- [ ] Test Pro customization options
- [ ] Test with different result counts

---

## Environment Variables Required

Add to `.env`:
```bash
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@unbuilt.app
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Puppeteer Performance:**
   - PDF generation can be slow for large reports
   - Consider implementing queue system for production

2. **Memory Usage:**
   - Large exports held in memory
   - Consider streaming for very large datasets

3. **Email Delivery:**
   - Requires SMTP configuration
   - May need rate limiting for production

4. **Progress Tracking:**
   - In-memory storage (not persistent)
   - Will reset on server restart
   - Consider Redis for production

---

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Backend Routes:**
   - Create `/api/export` endpoint
   - Create `/api/export/progress/:id` endpoint
   - Integrate with exportService

2. **Add Queue System (Optional):**
   - Use Bull or similar for background jobs
   - Better handling of concurrent exports

3. **Add Caching:**
   - Cache generated exports temporarily
   - Reduce regeneration for same data

4. **Add Analytics:**
   - Track export format preferences
   - Monitor export success rates
   - Track email delivery rates
