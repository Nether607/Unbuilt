## Key Responsive Features Implemented

### Breakpoint Strategy
- **Mobile First**: Base styles target mobile devices
- **sm (640px)**: Tablet portrait adjustments
- **md (768px)**: Tablet landscape adjustments  
- **lg (1024px)**: Desktop adjustments

### Touch-Friendly Controls
- All interactive elements have minimum 44px tap targets
- Added `touch-manipulation` class to prevent double-tap zoom
- Proper spacing between touch targets

### Typography Scaling
- Headings scale from 3xl → 6xl across breakpoints
- Body text scales from sm/base → base/lg
- Proper line-height for readability

### Layout Adaptations
- Flex layouts change from column to row at appropriate breakpoints
- Grids adapt from 1 column → 2 columns → 3/4 columns
- Sidebars hide on mobile, show on desktop
- Navigation collapses to hamburger menu on mobile (already in layout)

### Spacing System
- Consistent use of responsive spacing: `gap-2 sm:gap-3 md:gap-4`
- Padding scales appropriately: `p-4 sm:p-6`
- Margins adjust for mobile: `mb-4 sm:mb-6 md:mb-8`

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. Test on actual mobile devices (iOS and Android)
2. Test on tablets in both orientations
3. Test on desktop at various widths
4. Verify touch targets are easily tappable
5. Check text readability without zooming

### Breakpoint Testing
- 320px (small mobile)
- 375px (iPhone)
- 640px (tablet portrait)
- 768px (tablet landscape)
- 1024px (desktop)
- 1440px+ (large desktop)

### Lighthouse Testing
- Run mobile Lighthouse audit
- Target score: >90 for mobile
- Check for tap target sizing issues
- Verify viewport meta tag

## Requirements Addressed
- ✅ 4.1: Mobile-optimized layout displays correctly
- ✅ 4.2: Touch-friendly controls with appropriate spacing (44px minimum)
- ✅ 4.7: Text is readable without zooming

## Next Steps
- Task 5.2: Optimize mobile forms and inputs
- Task 5.3: Create mobile-responsive charts
- Task 5.4: Implement mobile navigation enhancements
- Task 5.5: Test mobile responsiveness with Lighthouse

## Notes
- All changes maintain existing functionality
