# Requirements Document - Fix Test Debt

## Introduction

This spec addresses the technical debt created by skipping 550+ tests in the code quality improvements phase. Currently, critical security and integration tests are skipped or deleted, leaving major functionality untested. This creates significant risk and provides false confidence in code coverage metrics.

The goal is to properly fix the test infrastructure, restore deleted tests, un-skip failing tests, and achieve genuine test coverage of critical application features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Infrastructure Repair

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable test infrastructure so that I can write and run tests without import errors or mock failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests import from the database THEN they SHALL use proper mock implementations without import errors
2. WHEN tests need database operations THEN they SHALL use a consistent mocking strategy across all test files
3. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL have access to all required dependencies without path resolution errors
4. IF a test requires external services THEN the test infrastructure SHALL provide appropriate mocks
5. WHEN test setup runs THEN it SHALL properly initialize the test environment without errors

### Requirement 2: Authentication Integration Tests

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive authentication tests so that I can verify users can securely register, login, and manage sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL create an account and return success
2. WHEN a user logs in with correct credentials THEN the system SHALL issue valid JWT tokens
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session
4. WHEN a JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL reject requests with that token
5. WHEN a refresh token is used THEN the system SHALL issue new access tokens
6. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL reject authentication attempts
7. WHEN authentication tests run THEN they SHALL verify the complete authentication flow end-to-end

### Requirement 3: Account Security Tests

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want account lockout and password history tests so that I can verify brute force protection and password policy enforcement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user fails login multiple times THEN the system SHALL lock the account
2. WHEN an account is locked THEN the system SHALL reject login attempts until unlock
3. WHEN the lockout period expires THEN the system SHALL allow login attempts again
4. WHEN a user changes password THEN the system SHALL prevent reuse of recent passwords
5. WHEN password history is checked THEN the system SHALL maintain the configured history length
6. WHEN account security tests run THEN they SHALL verify all security policies are enforced

### Requirement 4: Input Validation Tests

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive input validation tests so that I can verify the application blocks malicious input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN malicious SQL is submitted THEN the system SHALL sanitize or reject the input
2. WHEN XSS payloads are submitted THEN the system SHALL sanitize or reject the input
3. WHEN invalid data types are submitted THEN the system SHALL reject the input with clear errors
4. WHEN input exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL reject the input
5. WHEN special characters are submitted THEN the system SHALL properly escape or sanitize them
6. WHEN validation tests run THEN they SHALL verify all input validation middleware works correctly

### Requirement 5: Application Integration Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want end-to-end application tests so that I can verify all major features work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN all routes SHALL be properly registered
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL respond with correct status codes and data
3. WHEN middleware is applied THEN it SHALL execute in the correct order
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently across the application
5. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL verify complete user workflows from start to finish

### Requirement 6: Security Middleware Tests

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive security middleware tests so that I can verify all security controls are functioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rate limiting is enabled THEN it SHALL block excessive requests
2. WHEN HTTPS enforcement is enabled THEN it SHALL redirect HTTP to HTTPS
3. WHEN CSRF protection is enabled THEN it SHALL validate CSRF tokens
4. WHEN session security is enabled THEN it SHALL detect and prevent session hijacking
5. WHEN security headers are applied THEN they SHALL include all required headers
6. WHEN security middleware tests run THEN they SHALL verify all security controls work correctly

### Requirement 7: Service Layer Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive service layer tests so that I can verify core business logic works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JWT service creates tokens THEN they SHALL be valid and properly signed
2. WHEN session manager creates sessions THEN they SHALL be properly tracked and validated
3. WHEN security logger logs events THEN they SHALL be properly formatted and stored
4. WHEN CAPTCHA service generates challenges THEN they SHALL be valid and verifiable
5. WHEN service tests run THEN they SHALL verify all service methods work correctly

### Requirement 8: Test Coverage Metrics

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want accurate test coverage metrics so that I can understand the actual test coverage of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coverage is measured THEN it SHALL include all un-skipped tests
2. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN they SHALL accurately reflect tested code
3. WHEN critical security components are measured THEN they SHALL have >80% coverage
4. WHEN overall coverage is measured THEN it SHALL be >70% for active code
5. WHEN coverage metrics are reported THEN they SHALL exclude intentionally untested code (external services, build tools)

### Requirement 9: Test Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear test documentation so that I can understand how to write and run tests correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new tests THEN developers SHALL have clear examples to follow
2. WHEN tests fail THEN developers SHALL have troubleshooting guides
3. WHEN mocking is needed THEN developers SHALL have documented mock patterns
4. WHEN test infrastructure changes THEN documentation SHALL be updated
5. WHEN new developers join THEN they SHALL have comprehensive testing guides

### Requirement 10: Continuous Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run automatically in CI so that I can catch issues before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN all tests SHALL run automatically
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the build SHALL fail and notify developers
3. WHEN tests pass THEN coverage reports SHALL be generated
4. WHEN pull requests are created THEN tests SHALL run before merge
5. WHEN CI runs THEN it SHALL use the same test configuration as local development

## Success Criteria

### Phase Complete When:
- All 550+ skipped tests are either fixed and passing, or documented as intentionally skipped with clear reasoning
- Test infrastructure has no import errors or mock failures
- Authentication integration tests are passing (21 tests)
- Account security tests are restored and passing (30+ tests)
- Input validation tests are restored and passing (84+ tests)
- Application integration tests are restored and passing (20+ tests)
- Security middleware tests are un-skipped and passing (150+ tests)
- Service layer tests are un-skipped and passing (100+ tests)
- Overall test coverage is >70% for active code
- Critical security components have >80% coverage
- Test documentation is complete and accurate
- All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline

### Quality Metrics:
- **Test Pass Rate:** 100% (no skipped tests except documented exceptions)
- **Test Coverage:** >70% overall, >80% for security components
- **Test Reliability:** <1% flaky test rate
- **Test Speed:** Full suite runs in <5 minutes
- **Documentation:** 100% of test patterns documented

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this spec:
- Performance testing or load testing
- End-to-end UI testing with browser automation
- Testing of external service integrations (AI services, email, PDF generation)
- Testing of build tools (Vite, bundlers)
- Testing of unused/legacy code marked for deletion

## Dependencies

- Completion of code quality improvements spec (Phase 2)
- Access to test database or ability to use in-memory database
- Existing test infrastructure (Vitest, mocks, fixtures)
- Working examples from passing tests (search.integration.test.ts)

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Tests reveal actual bugs
**Mitigation:** This is actually good - fix the bugs as they're discovered

### Risk 2: Test infrastructure changes break existing tests
**Mitigation:** Fix tests incrementally, verify each batch before moving on

### Risk 3: Time estimates are too optimistic
**Mitigation:** Prioritize critical security tests first, defer less critical tests if needed

### Risk 4: Mocking strategy doesn't work for all cases
**Mitigation:** Document cases that need different approaches, create multiple mock patterns

## Notes

- This spec addresses technical debt from the previous code quality improvements phase
- The goal is to have genuine test coverage, not just good-looking metrics
- Tests should be fixed properly, not skipped to make metrics look better
- This work is critical for application security and reliability
