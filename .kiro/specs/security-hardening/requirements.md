# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing comprehensive security hardening for the application to address critical vulnerabilities including authentication bypasses, SQL injection risks, missing environment validation, and hardcoded credentials. The security hardening will transform the current demo-level security into production-ready authentication and authorization systems while maintaining the existing user experience and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper JWT-based authentication to replace the demo authentication system, so that user data is protected and access is properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to authenticate THEN the system SHALL validate credentials using secure JWT tokens instead of demo authentication
2. WHEN a JWT token is issued THEN the system SHALL include proper expiration times and secure signing
3. WHEN a JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
4. WHEN an invalid or expired token is presented THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate error messages
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to login and prevent access to protected resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all database queries to use parameterized queries through Drizzle ORM, so that SQL injection attacks are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database query is executed THEN the system SHALL use Drizzle ORM parameterized queries exclusively
2. WHEN raw SQL is encountered in auth routes THEN the system SHALL replace it with Drizzle ORM equivalents
3. WHEN user input is processed for database operations THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all inputs
4. IF malicious SQL is attempted THEN the system SHALL reject the query without executing it
5. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL log security events without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive environment variable validation on startup, so that missing configurations are caught early and don't cause silent failures in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
2. WHEN critical API keys are missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start with clear error messages
3. WHEN optional environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL log warnings and use secure defaults
4. IF environment validation fails THEN the system SHALL not start and provide specific remediation steps
5. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN the system SHALL mask sensitive values in logs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all hardcoded credentials removed from the codebase, so that unauthorized access is prevented and credentials can be properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL not contain any hardcoded usernames or passwords
2. WHEN demo credentials are needed for development THEN the system SHALL use environment variables or secure configuration files
3. WHEN documentation references credentials THEN the system SHALL use placeholder examples instead of real values
4. IF hardcoded credentials are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment
5. WHEN credentials are rotated THEN the system SHALL support updates without code changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent and secure error handling across all API endpoints, so that sensitive information is not leaked and debugging is still possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any API endpoint THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses
2. WHEN database errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed information internally but return generic messages to clients
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL not reveal whether the username or password was incorrect
4. IF sensitive data might be exposed in errors THEN the system SHALL sanitize error messages
5. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL include sufficient context for debugging without exposing credentials

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure session management and proper authorization checks, so that users can only access their own data and administrative functions are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user session is created THEN the system SHALL implement secure session storage with proper expiration
2. WHEN a user accesses resources THEN the system SHALL verify they have permission for that specific resource
3. WHEN administrative functions are accessed THEN the system SHALL require elevated permissions
4. IF a user attempts to access another user's data THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
5. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL clean up session data and require re-authentication

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want comprehensive security logging and monitoring, so that security events can be tracked and potential breaches can be detected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL log login attempts, successes, and failures
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events with appropriate detail
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL log user actions for audit trails
4. IF rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL log potential abuse attempts
5. WHEN security logs are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure they cannot be tampered with by application users
