# Search Functionality Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ 401 Error on `/api/searches`
**Problem:** The recent searches query was failing with 401 Unauthorized

**Root Cause:** The query was being made before the access token was refreshed

**Solution:** The `initializeAuth()` function now runs on app load and refreshes the token before any queries are made. The timing should be correct now.

### 2. ✅ 400 Error on `/api/search`
**Problem:** Search requests were failing with validation error

**Root Cause:** The `searchFilters` state was `null` initially, and the server validation doesn't accept `null` - it expects either an object or `undefined`.

**Solution:** Updated `home.tsx` to only include filters in the request if they exist:

```typescript
// Before
const response = await apiRequest("POST", "/api/search", { 
  query,
  filters: searchFilters  // Could be null
});

// After
const requestBody: { query: string; filters?: SearchFilters } = { query };
if (searchFilters) {
  requestBody.filters = searchFilters;
}
const response = await apiRequest("POST", "/api/search", requestBody);
```

## Server Validation Schema

The `/api/search` endpoint expects:

```typescript
{
  query: string (1-2000 chars),
  filters?: {
    categories?: string[],
    innovationScore?: [number, number],  // exactly 2 numbers
    marketSize?: [number, number],       // exactly 2 numbers
    feasibilityScore?: [number, number], // exactly 2 numbers
    marketPotential?: string,
    keywords?: string[],
    sortBy?: 'innovation' | 'marketSize' | 'feasibility' | 'relevance',
    sortOrder?: 'asc' | 'desc'
  }
}
```

Note: The client's `SearchFilters` interface includes `dateRange`, but the server doesn't validate or use it yet. This is fine - the server will just ignore it.

## Testing

1. **Clear browser cache/cookies**
2. **Restart dev server**
3. **Login**
4. **Try searching** - should work now!
5. **Check recent searches** - should load without 401 errors

## What Should Happen

1. App loads → `initializeAuth()` runs
2. Token refresh succeeds → "✅ Access token refreshed successfully" in console
3. User profile loads
4. Recent searches query runs with token → should work
5. User searches → request includes token and valid data → should work

## If Still Having Issues

### 401 Errors
- Check console for "Access token refreshed successfully"
- Check Network tab for Authorization header on requests
- Verify refresh token cookie exists

### 400 Errors
- Check Network tab → Request payload
- Verify `filters` is either an object or not included
- Check server logs for validation details

## Files Modified

1. `client/src/pages/home.tsx` - Fixed filters being sent as null
2. `SEARCH_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation
