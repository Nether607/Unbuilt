### Technical Details

#### Type System Improvements
```typescript
// Before: Unsafe type mixing
user?: User & { jti: string }

// After: Proper type separation
export interface AuthenticatedUser extends Omit<DbUser, 'password'> {
  jti: string;
}
user?: AuthenticatedUser
```

#### Date Query Improvements
```typescript
// Before: Type errors with date comparisons
.where(gte(table.timestamp, date.toISOString()))

// After: SQL template for type safety
.where(sql`${table.timestamp} >= ${date.toISOString()}`)
```

### Performance
- No performance impact from type improvements
- Build time remains consistent
- Type checking adds minimal overhead

### Migration Notes
