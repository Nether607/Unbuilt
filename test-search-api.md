# Search API Debugging Guide

## Issue
Searches are completing but returning 0 results even though the code has fallback demo data.

## Possible Causes

### 1. API Keys Not Configured
- Check if `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` are set in environment
- Both services should fall back to demo data if not configured

### 2. Error in analyzeGaps Function
- The function might be throwing an error that's being caught silently
- Check server console for error messages

### 3. Database Issue
- Results might be created but not returned properly
- Check if `storage.createSearchResult` is working

### 4. Middleware Filtering Results
- The `validateSearchData` middleware might be filtering out results incorrectly

## Quick Test

To test if the API is working, you can:

1. Check server console logs when performing a search
2. Look for these log messages:
   - "üîç Using Perplexity AI for market gap discovery"
   - "Perplexity API failed, trying Gemini fallback"
   - "‚ö†Ô∏è No AI APIs configured - returning demo data"

3. Check the database to see if search results were created:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM search_results ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

## Temporary Fix for Testing

Since you're out of free searches, let's temporarily bypass the search limit for testing purposes.
