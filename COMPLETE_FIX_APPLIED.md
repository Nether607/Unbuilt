# Complete Fix Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Not Persisting ✅
**Problem**: Users were being logged out when navigating between pages.

**Root Cause**: 
- Refresh endpoint had strict rate limiting (10 requests per 15 minutes)
- App was calling refresh on every page load
- Rate limit was being hit, causing auth to fail

**Fix**: Increased rate limit from 10 to 100 requests per 15 minutes in `server/routes/auth.ts`

### 2. Search Results Not Displaying ✅
**Problem**: API returns 7 results but frontend shows 0.

**Root Causes**:
1. Middleware was filtering out search results (fixed earlier)
2. Query cache was set to `Infinity`, so old cached data was being used
3. Browser had cached the empty results from before the middleware fix

**Fixes**:
1. Fixed middleware to not filter search results (done earlier)
2. Changed global `staleTime` from `Infinity` to 5 minutes in `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`
3. Added `staleTime: 0` override for search results queries

## Files Modified

1. `server/routes/auth.ts` - Increased refresh rate limit
2. `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - Changed staleTime from Infinity to 5 minutes
3. `client/src/pages/search-results.tsx` - Added staleTime: 0 for fresh data
4. `server/middleware/queryValidation.ts` - Fixed search results filtering

## Testing Instructions

### IMPORTANT: Clear Browser Cache First!
The old cached data is still in your browser. You MUST:

1. **Clear browser cache completely**:
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Select "Cached images and files" → Clear data
   - Or use Incognito/Private window

2. **Restart the dev server** to load the new code

3. **Test the flow**:
   - Go to http://localhost:8000
   - Sign in with: Kiro@unbuilt.one / Demo@123
   - Perform a search
   - Click on the search result
   - You should see all 7 results displayed!

4. **Test navigation**:
   - Navigate back to home
   - You should STAY logged in
   - Navigate to search results again
   - Should still work

## Why Cache Clearing is Required

The browser has cached:
- Empty results from before the middleware fix
- Old auth state
- Stale query data

Even though we fixed the code, the browser will continue using the cached data until you clear it or it expires (which was set to never expire with `Infinity`).

## Architecture Issues Documented

See `AUTH_ARCHITECTURE_ISSUES.md` for detailed analysis of the authentication system's architectural problems and long-term recommendations.

## Summary

All core issues are now fixed:
1. ✅ Middleware correctly handles search results
2. ✅ Auth refresh rate limit increased
3. ✅ Query caching set to reasonable timeframe
4. ✅ Search results queries force fresh data

**Next step**: Clear your browser cache and test!
