# Task 12 Completion Report: Update Express Request Type Declarations

## Task Overview
Updated Express Request type declarations to use shared types and ensure consistent type safety across all middleware.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Centralized Type Declaration File
**File:** `server/types/express.d.ts`

Created a centralized type declaration file that extends the Express Request interface with all custom properties used throughout the application:

- **Authentication properties** (from jwtAuth middleware):
  - `user?: User` - Full user object from database
  - `token?: string` - JWT access token
  - `jti?: string` - JWT token ID for revocation tracking

- **Authorization properties** (from authorization middleware):
  - `userRole?: UserRole` - User's role (USER, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN)
  - `userPermissions?: Permission[]` - User's permissions array

- **Session properties** (from session middleware):
  - `sessionInfo?: { ... }` - Session metadata including device info, IP, timestamps

- **Security context** (from security monitoring middleware):
  - `requestId?: string` - Unique request ID for correlation
  - `securityContext?: { ... }` - Security-relevant information (IP, user agent, etc.)

- **Resource ownership** (from resource ownership middleware):
  - `resource?: any` - Loaded resource object
  - `resourceOwner?: number` - Resource owner's user ID

### 2. Updated Middleware Files
Removed duplicate type declarations from all middleware files and replaced them with imports of the centralized type declaration:

- `server/middleware/jwtAuth.ts` - Removed duplicate Request extension, kept AuthenticatedRequest interface
- `server/middleware/securityMonitoring.ts` - Removed duplicate security context declaration
- `server/middleware/resourceOwnership.ts` - Removed duplicate resource properties declaration
- `server/middleware/sessionManagement.ts` - Removed duplicate session info declaration
- `server/middleware/authorization.ts` - Removed duplicate authorization properties declaration

All files now import `'../types/express'` to access the centralized type declarations.

### 3. Updated Shared Types
**File:** `shared/types.ts`

Enhanced the `UserSession` interface to align with the JWT payload structure:

```typescript
export interface UserSession {
  id: number;           // User ID (from JWT sub field)
  email: string;        // User email
  plan: string;         // User plan/role (from JWT role field)
  jti: string;          // JWT token ID for token tracking and revocation
  iat?: number;         // Issued at timestamp
  exp?: number;         // Expiration timestamp
  type?: 'access' | 'refresh'; // Token type
}
```

## Verification

### Type Safety Confirmed
- All middleware files can now access `req.user`, `req.jti`, and `req.token` with proper types
- The `User` type from `@shared/schema` is consistently used across all middleware
- No TypeScript errors related to Request type extensions
- IDE autocomplete works correctly for all custom Request properties

### Files Verified
✅ `server/middleware/jwtAuth.ts` - Sets user, token, and jti
✅ `server/middleware/sessionManagement.ts` - Accesses user and jti
✅ `server/middleware/securityMonitoring.ts` - Accesses user for security context
✅ `server/middleware/resourceOwnership.ts` - Accesses user for ownership validation
✅ `server/middleware/authorization.ts` - Accesses user for authorization checks
✅ `server/middleware/rateLimiting.ts` - Accesses user for rate limiting keys

## Benefits

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- All Express Request type extensions are defined in one place
- Easier to maintain and update
- No risk of conflicting declarations

### 2. Improved Type Safety
- Consistent types across all middleware
- Full User type from database schema
- Proper optional chaining support with `?` operator

### 3. Better Developer Experience
- IDE autocomplete works correctly
- Clear documentation of available properties
- Easy to discover what properties are available on Request

### 4. Maintainability
- Adding new properties only requires updating one file
- Removing properties is safer (can see all usages)
- Clear separation of concerns

## Requirements Met

✅ **3.2** - Update `server/middleware/jwtAuth.ts` to use shared types
✅ **3.3** - Ensure `req.user` uses full `User` type consistently
✅ **3.3** - Add `req.jti` for JWT token ID
✅ **3.3** - Verify all middleware can access proper types

## Testing

### Manual Verification
- Ran `npm run check` to verify TypeScript compilation
- Confirmed no type errors related to Request extensions
- Verified all middleware files import the centralized types
- Checked that `req.user`, `req.jti`, and `req.token` are properly typed

### Type Coverage
- All authentication middleware: ✅
- All authorization middleware: ✅
- All session management middleware: ✅
- All security monitoring middleware: ✅
- All resource ownership middleware: ✅

## Next Steps

This task is complete. The next task (Task 13) will focus on fixing implicit 'any' types across the codebase, which includes:
- Adding explicit types to function parameters in route handlers
- Adding explicit return types to functions
- Replacing 'any' with proper types or 'unknown' where appropriate

## Notes

- The centralized type declaration file (`server/types/express.d.ts`) is automatically picked up by TypeScript because it's included in the `server/**/*` pattern in `tsconfig.json`
- The `declare global` pattern is used to extend the Express namespace globally
- The `export {}` at the end of the file ensures it's treated as a module
- All middleware files now have a single import statement for type extensions: `import '../types/express'`

**Task Status:** ✅ Complete

**Requirements:** 3.2, 3.3
