## Known Issues and Limitations

### Non-Critical Items

1. **Lower Coverage in Some Services**
   - Acceptable due to unimplemented features
   - Tests are skipped intentionally
   - Will be addressed when features are implemented

2. **Search Integration Tests Slow**
   - 2-second delays per test (by design)
   - Total: 64.5 seconds for 30 tests
   - Still well under 5-minute target
   - Could be optimized if needed

3. **Some Error Logging in Tests**
   - Expected error logging from error handling tests
   - Not actual failures
   - Part of testing error scenarios

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

None required - all systems operational ‚úÖ

### Future Enhancements

1. **Coverage Improvements** (Optional)
   - Increase coverage for service layer components
   - Add tests for unimplemented features when developed
   - Consider integration tests for websocket functionality

2. **Performance Optimization** (Optional)
   - Reduce search test delays if faster feedback needed
   - Parallelize test execution further
   - Optimize database mock setup

3. **CI/CD Integration** (Recommended)
   - Set up automated test runs on push
   - Configure coverage reporting
   - Add test failure notifications
   - Set up coverage badges
