3. **Detailed** - Comprehensive analysis with all data

#### Dependencies

- `@shared/schema` - SearchResult type definition
- **No external packages** - Pure TypeScript/HTML generation

#### Recommendation

**✅ KEEP** - Active export feature, part of Pro plan value proposition. No external dependencies means no API costs or rate limits.

### 3. Email Service ⚠️ PREPARED FOR FUTURE USE

**File:** `server/services/email.ts`  
**Status:** **NOT YET INTEGRATED - Future Feature**  
**Usage:** SendGrid integration for transactional emails

#### Current Implementation Status

**✅ Implemented:**
- SendGrid integration with `@sendgrid/mail` package
- Graceful fallback when API key not configured
- HTML and text email templates for password reset
- Proper error handling and logging
- Type-safe email parameters

**❌ Not Yet Connected:**
- No authentication routes call password reset emails
- Export email feature is stubbed out (logs only)
- No active imports or usage in the codebase

#### Potential Use Cases

1. **Password Reset Flow** - Email with reset token link
2. **Email Reports** - Send market gap analysis reports via email
3. **Notifications** - General transactional emails

#### Dependencies

- `@sendgrid/mail` (v8.1.5) - SendGrid email client (~200KB)
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Environment variable (optional)

#### Recommendation

**✅ KEEP** - Well-implemented service ready for future features. Small dependency size (~200KB), graceful fallback behavior, and follows best practices.
