## Failure Categories

### 1. Database Mocking Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Impact:** 50+ test failures  
**Root Cause:** Mock database not properly implementing Drizzle ORM methods

**Affected Tests:**
- `server/services/__tests__/auth.integration.test.ts` (13 failures)
- `server/services/__tests__/sessionSecurity.test.ts` (24 failures)
- `server/services/__tests__/sessionManager.test.ts` (4 failures)
- `server/services/__tests__/securityMonitoring.integration.test.ts` (7 failures)

**Error Pattern:**
```
Error: Cannot find module '../../db'
TypeError: db.select(...).from(...).where(...).orderBy is not a function
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'set')
```

**Fix Required:**
- Update database mocks to properly implement all Drizzle ORM query builder methods
- Ensure mock database is properly injected in test setup
- Add missing methods: `orderBy()`, `groupBy()`, `set()`, etc.

---

### 2. Security Logger Mock Issues (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Impact:** 30+ test failures  
**Root Cause:** Security logger returning undefined instead of Promise

**Affected Tests:**
- `server/services/__tests__/securityLogger.test.ts` (11 failures)
- `server/__tests__/unit/middleware/securityHeaders.test.ts` (14 failures)
- `server/__tests__/unit/middleware/httpsEnforcement.test.ts` (2 failures)
- `server/__tests__/unit/middleware/securityMonitoring.test.ts` (6 failures)

**Error Pattern:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'catch')
AssertionError: expected "info" to be called with arguments
```

**Fix Required:**
- Update security logger mock to return Promises
- Ensure all async methods properly resolve/reject
- Fix `.catch()` chain expectations in middleware

---

### 3. User Agent Parsing Issues (LOW PRIORITY)
**Impact:** 3 test failures  
**Root Cause:** Device detection logic not matching expected values

**Affected Tests:**
- `server/services/__tests__/sessionManager.test.ts` (3 failures)

**Error Pattern:**
```
Expected: "Android", Received: "Linux"
Expected: "iOS", Received: "macOS"  
Expected: "Edge", Received: "Chrome"
```

**Fix Required:**
- Update user agent parsing logic to better detect mobile devices
- Improve browser detection for Edge
- Update test expectations to match actual parsing behavior

---

### 4. Validation Middleware Issues (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Impact:** 2 test failures  
**Root Cause:** Error response format mismatch

**Affected Tests:**
- `server/middleware/__tests__/validation.integration.test.ts` (2 failures)

**Error Pattern:**
```
expected undefined to be defined (error field missing)
expected 400 "Bad Request", got 500 "Internal Server Error"
```

**Fix Required:**
- Ensure validation errors return proper error response format
- Add malformed JSON handling middleware
- Standardize error response structure

---

### 5. Rate Limiting CAPTCHA Issues (LOW PRIORITY)
**Impact:** 2 test failures  
**Root Cause:** CAPTCHA validation logic not matching test expectations

**Affected Tests:**
- `server/services/__tests__/captchaService.test.ts` (1 failure)
- `server/__tests__/unit/middleware/rateLimiting.test.ts` (1 failure)

**Error Pattern:**
```
expected 'CAPTCHA challenge not found or expired' to contain 'Maximum'
Rate limit exceeded despite valid CAPTCHA token
```

**Fix Required:**
- Update CAPTCHA attempt limit error messages
- Fix CAPTCHA token validation in rate limiting middleware
- Ensure CAPTCHA bypass works correctly

---

### 6. Authentication Integration Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Impact:** 2 test failures  
**Root Cause:** Registration and login endpoints returning unexpected status codes

**Affected Tests:**
- `server/__tests__/integration/auth.integration.test.ts` (2 failures)

**Error Pattern:**
```
expected [ 200, 201 ] to include 400 (registration)
expected 200, got 500 (login)
```

**Fix Required:**
- Debug registration endpoint to understand 400 response
- Fix login endpoint 500 error
- Ensure proper error handling in auth routes

---

### 7. Session Cleanup Issues (LOW PRIORITY)
**Impact:** 1 test failure  
**Root Cause:** Mock database not returning deleted count

**Affected Tests:**
- `server/services/__tests__/sessionManager.test.ts` (1 failure)

**Error Pattern:**
```
expected 0 to be 5 (cleanup count)
```

**Fix Required:**
- Update mock database to return proper delete count
- Ensure cleanup function properly counts deleted sessions

---

### 8. Security Monitoring Context Issues (LOW PRIORITY)
**Impact:** 3 test failures  
**Root Cause:** Security context not being properly attached to request

**Affected Tests:**
- `server/__tests__/unit/middleware/securityMonitoring.test.ts` (3 failures)

**Error Pattern:**
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'userAgent')
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'userId')
expected body to be undefined (sanitization issue)
```

**Fix Required:**
- Ensure `addSecurityContext` middleware properly attaches context
- Fix request body sanitization for sensitive endpoints
- Update test mocks to properly simulate middleware chain

## Conclusion

The test suite execution revealed significant issues that need to be addressed before achieving the >70% coverage target. The main blockers are:

1. **Database mocking** - Preventing ~50 tests from running correctly
2. **Security logger mocking** - Causing ~30 test failures
3. **Integration test issues** - Auth flows not working as expected

### Current Status vs. Requirements

| Requirement | Target | Current | Status |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------|
| All tests pass | 100% | 73.7% | ❌ |
| Coverage >70% | >70% | Unknown | ❌ |
| No flaky tests | 0 | ~5 | ⚠️ |
| Coverage report | Generated | Not generated | ❌ |

### Next Steps

1. **Fix database mocks** - This will unblock ~50 tests
2. **Fix security logger mocks** - This will unblock ~30 tests
3. **Debug auth integration** - Fix the 2 critical auth test failures
4. **Re-run tests** - Generate coverage report after fixes
5. **Verify >70% coverage** - Confirm target is met

### Estimated Time to Complete
- Fix database mocks: 2-3 hours
- Fix security logger mocks: 1-2 hours
- Fix auth integration: 1-2 hours
- Re-run and verify: 30 minutes
- **Total:** 4.5-7.5 hours
