# Service Audit Report

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Auditor:** Kiro AI Assistant  
**Purpose:** Identify unused services and document active services for Phase 2.2 of Code Quality Improvements

---

## Executive Summary

This audit examined three services to determine their usage status and document their purpose:
- ✅ **Perplexity Service** - ACTIVE and USED
- ⚠️ **Email Service** - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (Not actively used)
- ⏳ **PDF Generator Service** - Pending audit

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Perplexity Service ✅ ACTIVE

**File:** `server/services/perplexity.ts`  
**Status:** **USED - Keep and Document**  
**Last Updated:** Active in current codebase

#### Usage Analysis

**Direct Imports Found:**
- `server/services/gemini.ts` - Line 4: `import { discoverMarketGaps, type MarketGap } from "./perplexity"`

**Function Calls:**
- `server/services/gemini.ts` - Line 33: `const perplexityResults = await discoverMarketGaps(query);`

**Call Chain:**
```
User Request → API Route → gemini.analyzeGaps() → perplexity.discoverMarketGaps()
```

#### Purpose

The Perplexity service provides real-time market research and trend analysis using the Perplexity AI API. It's the primary service for discovering market gaps and business opportunities.

#### Key Features

1. **Market Gap Discovery** - Identifies untapped business opportunities
2. **Real-time Web Search** - Uses Perplexity's online search capabilities
3. **Fallback Data** - Provides demo data when API key is not configured
4. **Structured Output** - Returns typed `MarketGap[]` results

#### Integration Points

- **Primary Consumer:** `server/services/gemini.ts`
  - Used as the first choice for market gap analysis
  - Gemini acts as fallback if Perplexity fails
  
- **Environment Configuration:**
  - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` - Required for API access
  - Documented in `.env.example` and `deployment/production.env.example`
  - Validated in `server/config/envValidator.ts`

#### Dependencies

- **axios** (v1.11.0) - HTTP client for API requests
- **PERPLEXITY_API_KEY** - Environment variable for authentication

#### API Surface

```typescript
export interface MarketGap {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  feasibility: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  marketPotential: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  innovationScore: number;
  marketSize: string;
  gapReason: string;
  competitors?: string[];
  targetAudience?: string;
  keyTrends?: string[];
}

export async function discoverMarketGaps(query: string): Promise<MarketGap[]>
```

#### Recommendation

**✅ KEEP** - This service is actively used and provides core functionality for the market gap analysis feature. It should be:
1. Retained in the codebase
2. Documented in `docs/SERVICES.md`
3. Maintained with current dependencies

### 2. Email Service ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**File:** `server/services/email.ts`  
**Status:** **NOT ACTIVELY USED - Consider for Future Implementation**  
**Last Updated:** October 3, 2025

#### Usage Analysis

**Direct Imports Found:**
- ❌ No imports found in any active code files
- The service is defined but never imported or called

**Function Calls:**
- ❌ `sendEmail()` - Not called anywhere in codebase
- ❌ `sendPasswordResetEmail()` - Not called anywhere in codebase

**Route References:**
- `server/routes.ts` - Lines 62, 283, 782: References to `sendEmailReport` from `./routes/export`
- `server/routes/export.ts` - Line 92: `sendEmailReport()` function exists but does NOT import or use the email service

#### Purpose

The Email service provides SendGrid integration for sending transactional emails, specifically:
1. Generic email sending via `sendEmail()`
2. Password reset emails via `sendPasswordResetEmail()`

#### Current Implementation Status

**✅ Implemented:**
- SendGrid integration with `@sendgrid/mail` package
- Graceful fallback when API key not configured (logs instead of sending)
- HTML and text email templates for password reset
- Proper error handling and logging

**❌ Not Connected:**
- No authentication routes call `sendPasswordResetEmail()`
- Export route `sendEmailReport()` only logs, doesn't actually send emails
- No imports of the email service functions anywhere in the codebase

#### Code Analysis

**Email Service Functions:**
```typescript
// Defined but never imported
export async function sendEmail(params: EmailParams): Promise<boolean>
export async function sendPasswordResetEmail(email: string, resetToken: string): Promise<boolean>
```

**Export Route Implementation:**
```typescript
// server/routes/export.ts - Line 92
export async function sendEmailReport(req: Request, res: Response) {
  // Only logs, doesn't actually send email
  console.log(`Sending report to ${email} with ${resultIds?.length ?? 0} results`);
  res.json({ success: true, message: `Report queued for ${email}` });
}
```

#### Integration Points

**Environment Configuration:**
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Documented in `.env.example`
- Validated in `server/config/envValidator.ts` as optional service
- Included in deployment documentation

**Dependencies:**
- `@sendgrid/mail` (v8.1.5) - Installed in package.json
- SendGrid account and verified sender domain required

#### Potential Use Cases

The service appears to be prepared for:
1. **Password Reset Flow** - Email with reset token link
2. **Email Reports** - Send market gap analysis reports via email
3. **Notifications** - General transactional emails

#### Recommendation

**⚠️ KEEP BUT MARK AS FUTURE FEATURE** - This service is:
- ✅ Well-implemented with proper error handling
- ✅ Has graceful fallback when not configured
- ✅ Follows good practices (HTML + text emails, proper templates)
- ❌ Not currently integrated into any features
- ❌ No authentication flow uses password reset emails
- ❌ Export email feature is stubbed out

**Options:**

**Option A: Keep for Future Use (Recommended)**
- Mark as "planned feature" in documentation
- Keep the code as it's well-written and doesn't cause issues
- Document in SERVICES.md as "Not Yet Integrated"
- Implement when password reset or email reports are prioritized

**Option B: Remove Temporarily**
- Remove the service file
- Remove `@sendgrid/mail` dependency (~200KB)
- Remove environment variable references
- Re-implement when needed

**Recommendation: Option A** - The service is well-implemented and the dependency is small. Keeping it allows for quick integration when email features are prioritized.

### 3. PDF Generator Service ✅ ACTIVE

**File:** `server/services/pdf-generator.ts`  
**Status:** **USED - Keep and Document**  
**Last Updated:** October 3, 2025

#### Usage Analysis

- `server/routes/export.ts` - Line 3: `import { pdfGenerator, PDFOptions } from "../services/pdf-generator"`

**Function Calls:**
- `server/routes/export.ts` - Line 72: `const html = pdfGenerator.generateHTML(results, pdfOptions);`

**Route Registration:**
- `server/routes.ts` - Lines 62, 280, 781: Export route registered at `/api/export`
- Route is protected with `jwtAuth` middleware and rate limiting

**Frontend Integration:**
- `client/src/components/export-modal.tsx` - Line 78: Calls `/api/export` endpoint
- Export modal provides UI for users to export results in multiple formats

**Call Chain:**
```
User clicks Export → ExportModal → POST /api/export → exportResults() → pdfGenerator.generateHTML()
```

#### Purpose

- Includes customization fields for title and intro

**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/export`
- Protected route requiring authentication
- Rate limited to prevent abuse
- Accepts format, result IDs, and options
- Returns HTML file for download

#### Dependencies

```typescript
export interface PDFOptions {
  format: 'executive' | 'pitch' | 'detailed';
  customTitle?: string;
  customIntro?: string;
  includeDetails?: boolean;
  companyName?: string;
  authorName?: string;
}

export class PDFGenerator {
  generateHTML(results: SearchResult[], options: PDFOptions): string;
}

export const pdfGenerator: PDFGenerator;
```

#### Report Structure

**Executive Format:**
- Market Analysis Overview with statistics
- Strategic Opportunities section
- Opportunities by Category breakdown

**Pitch Format:**
- Eye-catching market opportunity headline
- Top 3 innovation opportunities
