# Service Audit Report

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Auditor:** Kiro AI Assistant  
**Purpose:** Identify unused services and document active services for Phase 2.2 of Code Quality Improvements

---

## Executive Summary

This audit examined three services to determine their usage status and document their purpose:
- ✅ **Perplexity Service** - ACTIVE and USED
- ⏳ **Email Service** - Pending audit
- ⏳ **PDF Generator Service** - Pending audit

---

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Perplexity Service ✅ ACTIVE

**File:** `server/services/perplexity.ts`  
**Status:** **USED - Keep and Document**  
**Last Updated:** Active in current codebase

#### Usage Analysis

**Direct Imports Found:**
- `server/services/gemini.ts` - Line 4: `import { discoverMarketGaps, type MarketGap } from "./perplexity"`

**Function Calls:**
- `server/services/gemini.ts` - Line 33: `const perplexityResults = await discoverMarketGaps(query);`

**Call Chain:**
```
User Request → API Route → gemini.analyzeGaps() → perplexity.discoverMarketGaps()
```

#### Purpose

The Perplexity service provides real-time market research and trend analysis using the Perplexity AI API. It's the primary service for discovering market gaps and business opportunities.

#### Key Features

1. **Market Gap Discovery** - Identifies untapped business opportunities
2. **Real-time Web Search** - Uses Perplexity's online search capabilities
3. **Fallback Data** - Provides demo data when API key is not configured
4. **Structured Output** - Returns typed `MarketGap[]` results

#### Integration Points

- **Primary Consumer:** `server/services/gemini.ts`
  - Used as the first choice for market gap analysis
  - Gemini acts as fallback if Perplexity fails
  
- **Environment Configuration:**
  - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` - Required for API access
  - Documented in `.env.example` and `deployment/production.env.example`
  - Validated in `server/config/envValidator.ts`

#### Dependencies

- **axios** (v1.11.0) - HTTP client for API requests
- **PERPLEXITY_API_KEY** - Environment variable for authentication

#### API Surface

```typescript
export interface MarketGap {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  feasibility: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  marketPotential: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  innovationScore: number;
  marketSize: string;
  gapReason: string;
  competitors?: string[];
  targetAudience?: string;
  keyTrends?: string[];
}

export async function discoverMarketGaps(query: string): Promise<MarketGap[]>
```

#### Recommendation

**✅ KEEP** - This service is actively used and provides core functionality for the market gap analysis feature. It should be:
1. Retained in the codebase
2. Documented in `docs/SERVICES.md`
3. Maintained with current dependencies
