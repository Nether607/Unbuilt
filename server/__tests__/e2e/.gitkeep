# End-to-End Tests

Place end-to-end tests in this directory.

E2E tests should:
- Test complete user workflows
- Simulate real user interactions
- Use real or test database
- May take longer (1s+ per test)

Example structure:
```
e2e/
├── user-registration-flow.test.ts
├── search-workflow.test.ts
└── payment-flow.test.ts
```
