## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing Strategy
1. **Isolation:** Each middleware component tested in isolation with mocked dependencies
2. **Mocking:** Security logger, config, and external dependencies properly mocked
3. **Coverage:** All code paths, edge cases, and error scenarios covered
4. **Assertions:** Comprehensive assertions on middleware behavior, headers, and logging

### Mock Infrastructure
- **Express Mocks:** Request, Response, NextFunction objects
- **Security Logger Mock:** All logging methods mocked with resolved promises
- **Config Mock:** Security configuration mocked for consistent test environment
- **UUID Mock:** Deterministic UUIDs for predictable test results

### Test Patterns
- **AAA Pattern:** Arrange, Act, Assert structure
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling verified
- **Edge Cases:** Boundary conditions and unusual inputs tested
- **Integration Points:** Middleware interactions with Express verified

## Requirements Satisfied
