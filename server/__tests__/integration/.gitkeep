# Integration Tests

Place integration tests in this directory.

Integration tests should:
- Test multiple components working together
- Test API endpoints with real HTTP requests
- May use test database or mocks
- Take moderate time (100ms-1s per test)

Example structure:
```
integration/
├── auth.test.ts
├── search.test.ts
├── analytics.test.ts
└── api.test.ts
```
