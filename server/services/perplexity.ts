2. Description: Detailed explanation of what this would be and how it works
3. Category: One of "Tech That's Missing", "Services That Don't Exist", "Products Nobody's Made", or "Business Models"
4. Feasibility: Rate as "high", "medium", or "low" based on current technology and resources
5. Market Potential: Rate as "high", "medium", or "low" based on demand and market size
6. Innovation Score: Rate from 1-10 (10 being most innovative)
7. Market Size: Estimated total addressable market (e.g., "$2.3B", "$890M")
8. Gap Reason: Why doesn't this exist yet?
9. Target Audience: Who would use this?
10. Key Trends: What current trends support this opportunity?

Focus on REAL gaps that don't exist yet but should. Be specific and actionable. Use current market data and trends.

/**
 * Generate fallback market gaps when Perplexity API is unavailable
 * 
 * This function provides intelligent fallback data when the Perplexity API fails or
 * is not configured. It uses simple keyword matching to provide contextually relevant
 * market gaps based on the user's query.
 * 
 * Strategy:
 * 1. Parse the query for domain-specific keywords (health, education, etc.)
 * 2. Return domain-specific gaps if keywords match
 * 3. Add general gaps to ensure we always return useful data
 * 4. Maintain consistent data structure with API responses
 * 
 * This ensures the application remains functional even without the external API,
 * providing a degraded but usable experience.
