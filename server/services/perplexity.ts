2. Description: Detailed explanation of what this would be and how it works
3. Category: One of "Tech That's Missing", "Services That Don't Exist", "Products Nobody's Made", or "Business Models"
4. Feasibility: Rate as "high", "medium", or "low" based on current technology and resources
5. Market Potential: Rate as "high", "medium", or "low" based on demand and market size
6. Innovation Score: Rate from 1-10 (10 being most innovative)
7. Market Size: Estimated total addressable market (e.g., "$2.3B", "$890M")
8. Gap Reason: Why doesn't this exist yet?
9. Target Audience: Who would use this?
10. Key Trends: What current trends support this opportunity?

Focus on REAL gaps that don't exist yet but should. Be specific and actionable. Use current market data and trends.
