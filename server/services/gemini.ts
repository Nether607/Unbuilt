  const prompt = `Analyze this market research query: "${query}"

Context: The user is an entrepreneur or innovator looking for untapped business opportunities. They need specific, actionable market gaps they could potentially address.

Your task: Identify 6-8 significant market gaps related to the query. These should be opportunities that:
- Don't currently exist in the market (or exist poorly)
- Have clear demand signals (complaints, workarounds, high friction)
- Could be realistically built/launched within 2-3 years
- Have identifiable early adopters and growth potential

For each gap, provide:
1. Title: A clear, memorable name for the solution (e.g., "AI-Powered Legal Document Reviewer")
2. Description: Comprehensive explanation including:
   - What problem it solves
   - How it works
   - Target users and use cases
   - Key differentiators from existing alternatives
3. Category: Choose ONE of these structured categories:
   - "market" - Market gaps and unmet customer needs
   - "technology" - Technology solutions not yet built
   - "ux" - User experience improvements and design gaps
   - "business_model" - New ways to monetize or deliver value
4. Feasibility: Rate as "high", "medium", or "low" considering:
   - Technical complexity
   - Resource requirements
   - Regulatory hurdles
   - Time to market
5. Market Potential: Rate as "high", "medium", or "low" based on:
   - Total addressable market
   - Growth trajectory
   - Customer willingness to pay
   - Competitive dynamics
6. Innovation Score: 1-10 scale where:
   - 1-3: Incremental improvements
   - 4-6: Notable innovations
   - 7-8: Breakthrough solutions
   - 9-10: Paradigm-shifting innovations
7. Market Size: Provide realistic TAM estimate (e.g., "$2.3B global market", "$450M in North America")
8. Gap Reason: Explain specifically why this doesn't exist yet:
   - Technical barriers
   - Regulatory challenges
   - Economic factors
   - Market timing issues
9. Confidence Score: 0-100 rating based on:
   - Data availability and quality
   - Market clarity and validation
   - Competitive landscape understanding
   - Industry expertise level
10. Priority: Calculate as "high", "medium", or "low" based on:
    - High: High market potential + High feasibility
    - Medium: Mixed potential and feasibility
    - Low: Low market potential or Low feasibility
11. Actionable Recommendations: Provide 3-5 specific next steps such as:
    - MVP development approach
    - Target customer segments
    - Partnership opportunities
    - Go-to-market strategies
    - Risk mitigation tactics
12. Competitor Analysis: Brief overview of existing solutions and competitive landscape
