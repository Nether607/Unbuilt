# Authentication Fix for Search Results

## The Issue

The server logs revealed the exact problem:

```
Error in GET /api/search/9: {message: 'No token provided'
GET /api/search/9 401 in 9ms :: Authentication failed
```

But the results endpoint worked fine:
```
GET /api/search/9/results 200 in 771ms :: Success
```

## Root Cause

In `client/src/pages/search-results.tsx`, the search query was using a custom `queryFn` with plain `fetch()`:

```typescript
queryFn: async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/search/${searchId}`);  // ❌ No auth header!
  const result = await response.json();
  return result?.data || result;
}
```

Plain `fetch()` doesn't include the Authorization header with the JWT token, so the request was rejected with 401 Unauthorized.

The results query worked because it used the default `queryFn` from the query client, which properly includes authentication.

## The Fix

Changed the search query to use `apiRequest` helper which automatically adds the Authorization header:

```typescript
queryFn: async () => {
  const response = await apiRequest("GET", `/api/search/${searchId}`);  // ✅ Includes auth!
  const result = await response.json();
  return result?.data || result;
}
```

## Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/search-results.tsx`

## Testing

Now when you:
1. Perform a search
2. Navigate to the results page

You should see:
- ✅ The search query displayed at the top
- ✅ All 7 market gap results shown
- ✅ No authentication errors
- ✅ Everything working perfectly!

## Complete Fix Summary

Throughout this debugging session, we fixed:

1. ✅ **Access Denied Error** - Type mismatch in middleware validation
2. ✅ **Results Filter Error** - Response wrapper not unwrapped  
3. ✅ **Missing Endpoint** - Added GET `/api/search/:id`
4. ✅ **Authentication Error** - Used `apiRequest` instead of plain `fetch()`

All issues resolved! 🎉
